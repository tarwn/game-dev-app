  Viabibility" and entering details about estimated sales, as well as any finer-grained detail you have on costs.

  This step will help you answer whether you can meet financial goals and, if you have expect to have partners for
  funding or provide revenue sharing, what that could look like as well.

  Be careful not to get too deep into the weeds and start tweaking values a little up or down to make things work. The
  goal here is to determine if the outcome broadly looks positive enough or not, to inform how and where we spend time.
  Real life will not match and will include things you hadn't considered. When in doubt, estimate conservatively.
