  Are you going to plan using a Concept/Pre-Production/Production/Post-Production pipeline? Is there an easy heuristic
  so folks can make decisions quickly without a full team vote? Share the finances monthly or wait for people to ask?
</p>
<p>
  There are high level decisions you can make now (or decide don't need to be made) that will make development smoother
  (and not derail you later, afterwards). As a small studio, you don't need the overhead a AAA does, so knocking out a
  starting plan for a number of things can be quick while still buying you back future development time.

<p>If you're working solo, the parts that are relevant will help you clear space to start going faster.</p>
<p>
  If you're working with a team, starting with an agreed setup means you can make small adjustments later instead of
  trying to set things up 3 days after they have derailed.
