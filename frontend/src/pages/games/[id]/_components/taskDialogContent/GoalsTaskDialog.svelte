  What do you need for this game to be successful? If you're not solo, what do other team membes (and the studio) need?
</p>
<p>
  Goals can be financial, can reflect a desire to learn, build exposure, or achieve a lifelong dream of shipping a game.
  Most importantly, defining them is the first step towards stacking the deck as you make decisions and tradeoffs on
  your game.

  If you're solo, this will help you prioritize and make decisions. If you're working with a team, this can ensure folks
  are aligned (or detect differences from the beginning and adjust for them).
