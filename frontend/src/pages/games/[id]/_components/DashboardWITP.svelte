<h1>This is the Game Dashboard</h1>

Every game has a main planning dashboard just like this one. It shows a quick summary of the game details, but more
importantly holds your Core Tasks.

<h2>Next Core Tasks</h2>
<p>When in doubt, this is the place to start ðŸ˜€</p>
<p>
  These are the tasks LaunchReady is tracking for you. Early on, they are more generic and high level. As you begin to
  make decisions from prototypes and user feedback, the tasks and guidance gets more custom and specific.
</p>
<h4>How to use?</h4>
<p>
  Click on a task to open up the details. Each task has options to make it the active task you're tracking for this
  game, skip it, or mark it completed.
</p>
<h2>Planning Modules</h2>
<p>
  Easy access directly to the main planning modules, whether you're working on a task for them or looking up a detail.
