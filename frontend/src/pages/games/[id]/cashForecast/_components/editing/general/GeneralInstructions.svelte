  <b>Forecast Stage</b> reflects the horizon of the forecast:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    "Runway to Launch": limits the forecast to help focus on entering costs to build and launch the game, "What will it
    cost to launch?"
  </li>
  <li>
    Later options include Launch + 18 months, 3 years, and 5 years as you narrow in on a plan, estimate sales, pitch
    others, and execute
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Start on "Runway to Launch", later tasks will walk through initial estimation and researching comparables</p>
<p>
  <b>Goals</b> are used for "Pricing vs Goals" analysis, to help show the impact and viability of different pricing + sales
  levels.
